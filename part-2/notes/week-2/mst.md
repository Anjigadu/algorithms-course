Minimum Spanning Tree
=

Given : A connected undirected graph with positive weights

A spannning tree is both Tree (a connected acyclic graph) and also spanning (includes all vertices)


Greedy Algorithm
-

Simplification

  * Assume that Graph is connected
  * and also unique edge weights

Consequence, the MST exists and unique


Cut Property
-
  A cut in a graph is a partition of its vertices into two ( non empty ) sets.
  
  A crossing edge is an edge connects a vertex from one set to another
