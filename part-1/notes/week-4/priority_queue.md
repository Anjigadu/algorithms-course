This is to remove the largest / smallest element from the collection.

Challenge
-

Where N is larger number we cannot accomodate in the memory and we're interested only the largest / smallest M items then ,

 -
  * Create a PQ
  * Insert elements one by one from the stream as incoming
  * if size of PQ more than M then delete min / max depends upon requirement

so with M space, we could store the M largest/smallest items from the huge N items.
